    <h3>Literature Survey</h3> <br>
    <p>This research integrates findings from multiple studies to enhance personalized learning in mathematics through cognitive profiling, stress detection, and adaptive lesson planning. A significant aspect of this work revolves around the impact of different problem types on student performance. Research shows that the types of problems selected by teachers greatly influence student outcomes, suggesting the importance of problem exposure and instructional design in shaping math achievement. Building on this, the current approach tests students using a 10-question math assessment to understand their strengths and weaknesses, allowing for the development of a hierarchy of learning preferences.

The study also draws from research that prioritizes student perspectives, such as “Learning Mathematics—Letting the Pupils Have Their Say” and “My Favourite Subject is Maths,” which highlight the influence of pedagogical methods on student engagement. This student-centered philosophy informs the research's use of personalized lesson plans tailored to learning styles and interests. Collaborative learning is also emphasized, with references to clustering-based group formation strategies, where students are paired based on complementary skills and communication preferences to enhance group dynamics and learning outcomes.

Cognitive capabilities, including working memory, attention, and reasoning, are essential in predicting math performance. Longitudinal studies have shown these factors are stable and predictive of achievement over time. Feuerstein’s cognitive testing model justifies using cognitive profiling to create tailored lesson plans, aligning well with this research’s use of interactive math games to assess cognitive traits.

Beyond cognition, motivation and self-efficacy are vital in shaping academic performance. Analysis indicates that intrinsic motivation and perceived competence significantly influence student outcomes alongside intelligence. The current study incorporates this understanding through motivational math games designed to boost confidence. Additionally, the relationship between cognitive skills and math ability evolves throughout education, with working memory and reasoning becoming stronger predictors at different stages. This insight guides the adaptive nature of the research’s personalized learning model.

Stress detection is another innovative feature. Deep learning models like TSDNet and CNN-based frameworks have shown effectiveness in using facial expression and motion data for stress assessment. This study applies similar techniques post-exam to recommend relaxation strategies and reduce math anxiety. Further, studies on sentiment analysis in MOOCs and non-contact stress detection via rPPG support the integration of these technologies in academic settings, affirming the feasibility and accuracy of such approaches.

Personalized learning models have been consistently shown to improve math achievement. Studies demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-powered educational tools and adaptive tutoring. The current research advances this by including dynamic factors like student interest and stress levels. Intelligent agent frameworks and reinforcement learning models further validate the benefits of adaptive path generation. This study enhances these by integrating self-organizing maps (SOMs) for continuously updating lesson plans based on real-time student data, ultimately promoting a more effective and holistic personalized learning experience.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="methodology" class="tab-content" style="display: none;">
    <h3>Methodology</h3> <br>
    <p>The study begins by collecting historical data from students, including the time taken to answer questions in a math questionnaire, scores from various lessons, and past academic performance. This data undergoes preprocessing using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a technique that helps identify hidden patterns and structures. With these insights, machine learning models are trained to personalize learning experiences. The first model predicts a hierarchy of lesson preferences, effectively identifying the mathematical topics each student is most inclined toward. The second model uses classification methods to determine the most compatible study partner for each student. This peer-matching model is designed not just on surface-level similarity but through predictive modeling to increase the effectiveness of collaboration.

To evaluate students’ cognitive capacities, the system gathers demographic information such as age, gender, and average sleep hours—factors known to impact cognitive performance. Students then participate in three types of gamified assessments: Memory Games to measure working memory, Speed Games to test reaction time, and Arithmetic Games to assess problem-solving skills under time constraints. The results from these games are again analyzed using SOMs, categorizing students into cognitive ability groups. To validate these categories, statistical analyses like ANOVA and t-tests are used, establishing significant correlations between cognitive traits and academic performance.

An external dataset containing similar student profiles and expert-labeled cognitive ability information is employed to train classification models such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. Once trained, the best-performing model is applied to the collected data, offering personalized feedback on each student’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses. This enables the development of targeted strategies to improve individual learning outcomes.

Addressing emotional factors, the system incorporates a stress detection module. Facial expressions are analyzed using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the AffectNet dataset. Simultaneously, vocal features are processed through another CNN trained on the TESS dataset. Both image and audio data undergo thorough preprocessing—facial images are augmented through techniques like contrast adjustment and flipping, while vocal recordings are converted into Mel spectrograms for effective feature extraction. The outputs from these models are combined using a weighted average method to classify stress levels accurately.

Based on the detected stress levels, a music recommendation module suggests appropriate audio therapy. Students experiencing high stress are recommended calming tracks, while those with lower stress levels receive uplifting or neutral music. Music features—such as spectral, rhythmic, and temporal components—are extracted from the GTZAN music dataset. K-means clustering is used to group songs by energy levels, ensuring that students are matched with music that supports their emotional state through music psychology principles.

Finally, the system integrates all this data—lesson preferences, cognitive assessment results, and stress levels—into an adaptive lesson recommendation engine. A classification model determines suitable learning paths tailored to the student's unique profile. High-performing, low-stress students are assigned advanced modules, whereas students with higher stress and lower cognitive scores receive a more structured and gradual curriculum. Lesson sequencing is further optimized using frontend filtering.

The entire system is deployed through a React.js frontend for user interaction, supported by a Node.js backend and a Flask API for real-time processing. This comprehensive, machine-learning-driven framework provides a truly personalized, effective, and engaging mathematics learning experience that not only boosts academic performance but also supports emotional and cognitive well-being.</p>

  <div id="problem" class="tab-content" style="display: none;">
    <h3>Research Problem</h3> <br>
    <p>Mathematics is a core subject in secondary school level, yet
the majority of students do not understand basic concepts due
to traditional instructions. This lack of personalized teaching
leads to boredom, stress, and poor achievement, particularly

in Sri Lanka, where mathematics is a prerequisite for ad-
vancement to tertiary education. Moreover, existing learning

systems fail to consider personal learning patterns, thinking
processes, and emotional states such as stress, which are
significant factors in academic success. Existing educational
models lack adaptive approaches that possess the ability to

change dynamically according to the individual learning style,
pace of learning, and emotional state of each learner. With no

personalized interventions, students cannot be given person-
alized support, leading to inefficiencies in learning outcomes.

Furthermore, opportunities for peer learning are left unutilized
since there is no intelligent peer-matching mechanism. The
purpose of this research is to fill in the gaps by creating
an adaptive learning system using Machine Learning (ML)

with built-in lesson preference prediction, best study peer pre-
diction, cognitive behavior analysis, stress detection together

with music recommendation and personalized lesson recom-
mendation. The system proposed aims to promote increased

student engagement, maximization of learning efficiency, and
improvement of mathematics education outcomes.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="gap" class="tab-content">
    <h3>Research Gap</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      This research aims to address the following gaps in existing
educational frameworks:
Lack of Personalized Learning Approaches: Most
existing systems follow a generic model, failing to cater
to individual learning styles, preferences, and progress.

Absence of Emotional and Stress Consideration: Cur-
rent learning methodologies do not account for students’

emotional states, particularly stress, which significantly
impacts learning outcomes.
Limited Use of Machine Learning in Mathematics

Education: While ML-driven solutions exist, their appli-
cation in adaptive mathematics education, especially for

lesson preference prediction and peer selection, remains
underexplored.

Underutilization of Gamification in Cognitive Assess-
ment: Many educational platforms do not effectively

leverage gamified approaches to assess and enhance cog-
nitive abilities in students.

Lack of Collaborative Learning Enhancements: Tra-
ditional learning environments often do not provide in-
telligent mechanisms for identifying the best study peers,

limiting collaborative learning opportunities.
